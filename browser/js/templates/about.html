		<h1>Hi! My name is Steve Colacurcio. I'm a full stack web developer and musician living in Brooklyn, New York.</h1>
		<!-- <img src="steve-pic.jpg"></img> -->
		<p>	I love writing code for the same reasons I enjoy writing music:
			the interplay between the left and right brain, the ability to see results immediately, and that great feeling of flow.</p>
		<p>When I'm not programming, I enjoy making weird music in Ableton Live, jamming with friends, exercising, and being outside.</p>
		<p>Check out the <a ui-sref="projects">projects</a> page to see my recent work,
			or head over to the <a ui-sref="contact">contact</a> page to say hi. I'm currently looking for work!</p>
