		<h1>I'm a web developer and musician living in Brooklyn, New York.</h1>
		<!-- <img src="steve-pic.jpg"></img> -->
		<p>	I love writing code for the same reasons I enjoy writing music:
			the balance between the left and right brain, the ability to see results immediately, and the feeling of flow it provides.</p>
		<p>When I'm not programming, I enjoy making weird noises in Ableton Live, jamming with friends, exercising, and being outside.</p>
